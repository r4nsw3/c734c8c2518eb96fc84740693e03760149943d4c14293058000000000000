  |   Hey folks, we have great news to share with you all! Tomorrow is a    |
  |   special day for the studio as it will be the one-year anniversary     |
  |   of Light Fall. As such, we've been secretly working on our biggest    |
  |   content update yet: the Lost Worlds Edition.                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   This update is the biggest we've done so far and is also totally      |
  |   free. For those of you who haven't purchased the game yet, here's     |
  |   your chance: Light Fall will have a 50% discount starting today       |
  |   until May 5!                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Lost Worlds Edition features secret levels to be unlocked in      |
  |   every Act of the game. The key to unlocking them is directly tied     |
  |   to the in-game collectibles - Paddlewood's memory shards! Once        |
  |   unlocked, these levels can be found in the Speedrun Mode. Make sure   |
  |   to shake the rust off, as these levels will challenge you like        |
  |   never before.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   This update also brings several quality of life improvements and a    |
  |   new Speedrun season! That's right, the leaderboards have been wiped   |
  |   out and it's time to compete once again for that number one spot.     |
  |   Note that the previous seasons' times are still accessible on the     |
  |   leaderboard. You can also see the full patch notes below.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   We sincerely hope you enjoy this new content and we thank you once    |
  |   again for your support. Lastly, we kindly ask of you to help us       |
  |   spread the word about the update. Also, writing a quick review on     |
  |   Steam would help us tremendously, as it provides more exposure to     |
  |   the game.                                                             |
